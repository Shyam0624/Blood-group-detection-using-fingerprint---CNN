# Blood-group-detection-using-fingerprint---CNN
Blood group detection using Fingerprint - use off cnn models like sequential, ResNet and MobileNet, that includes minutiae detection and segmentation, and Gabor filtering.

Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a system capable of accurately classifying blood groups (A, B, AB, O) using fingerprint images. For this project, here are the specific objectives structured:

• To develop an effective feature extraction integrated with optimized CNN architectures, such as ResNet and MobileNet, that includes minutiae detection and segmentation, and Gabor filtering.

• To refine data pre-processing and augmentation techniques for handling variations in fingerprint image quality, improving the model's ability to generalize across different fingerprints and skin textures.

• To develop a website application for real-time blood group detection, allowing for non-invasive blood typing among users
